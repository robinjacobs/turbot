Documentation of the turbot robot plattform
## About
The turbot robotic plattform is based on adafruit's Mini 3-Layer Round Robot kit, which is extended so that different sensors (cameras, ultrasound distance sensors), a battery pack and a Raspberry Pi can be mounted on it.

This repository holds the documentation for all the hardware and the software structure of the robot.
